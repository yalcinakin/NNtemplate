Artificial Neural Network template for fast coding on python.

Sample code is added in "ann_sample.py".
Given data in "Churn_Modelling.csv", ANN model predicts if the customer will leave the bank. Sample classifier is written on keras.

To run this project:
  1. Clone this repository
  3. Use classification_template.py
  4. Change csv file name to your file name.
  4. Add a classifier
  5. (Optional) Add evaluation and tuning of hyperparameters
